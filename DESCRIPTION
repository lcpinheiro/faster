Author: person("Luis", "Pinheiro", email = "luis.pinheiro@ema.europa.eu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package has four convenience functions for conducting analyses using 
    EudraVigilance data. These functions work on other data.
    Two functions are meant to expedite reading csv files and mutating date variables that
    are read as character variables in R (read_all_csv and mutate_all_date_cols).
    The function theme_basic_ema is a simplified ggplot2 theme.
    The function calculate_age is a function to calculate age, in years, between two dates,
    a birthdate and a reference date.
